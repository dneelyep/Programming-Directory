The acceleration and speed of bullets in the game is configured in the __init__ function of this file. The rate at whcih a bullet accelerates is controlled by member variable acceleration_divisor. We won't need to change that. However, the maximum speed a bullet will reach is defined ny max_velocity, and the lifetme of the bullet is defined by max_ticks.

Note that making this change in the Bullet class means all bullets in the game, including enemy bullets, will now work this way. So let's quickly deal with stopping bullets from wrapping as well. We'll add to the Bullet class's update function to see if the bullet is above or below the screen, and if so, we'll remove it. So we'll change the to of the update function in bullet.py to look like this: <placeholder-3/> Note that a Sprite's kill function, removes it from the game immediately, and with no fanfare. Finally, we need to adjust the bullet so it comes out from the guys the way we want it to. Since this is only related to the way the guy shoots bullets and won't have anything to do with enemy bullets, we'll configure how bullets emerge in the guy.py file. Let's just tweak the shoot function a bit. As you can see in this function, when you create a bullet, you provide it x and y coordinates. We'll just calculate at better x coordinate to start. We'll find the middle of the width of the guy's image, and offset it a bit so the bullet sprite looks like it comes out correctly. <progamlisting> center_x = (self.x + self.rect.width / 2) - 3 </progamlisting> So we change change the ugy's shoot funciton to look like this: <placeholder-4/>"

That's okay because we added padding to keep the enemies from ending up too close to the sides. The full init_position function you need to add looks like this: <placeholder-5/> When you run the game, you can see that the enemies are moving and are good targets to shoot at. But next we'll make the enemies fight back."

msgid "Let's add the ability for an enemy to drop a bomb. By default, enemies can't do anything like that, so we'll have to add a new function. The function will need to do the following things: <placeholder-1/> We should probably start with this last part. We'll want to create a special sprite group for the bullets to go into. This is primarily so that we can use the SpriteGroups collision detection capabilities later. Also it's easier to manage updates of sprites when they are in a group. First things first, we'll create the sprite group. There's a place in the bin/shooter for setting up enemies and such, so create another sprite group there. You create a sprite group by calling a function in the pygame.sprite module called \"RenderUpdates\". Lookk for the code block below, and notice the new line creating the new sprite group by calling RenderUpdates. <placeholder-2/> Now that we have the sprite group called enemy_bullets we want to do three more things with it for now. <placeholder-3/> So for the first part, we'll call the sprite group's empty function in next_level and reset_level This function simply removes each sprite in the sprite group from game play. Do this as the first thing for each of these function. <placeholder-4/> For the second point, we'll add to the function in bin/shooter called update_sprites. As you may have guessed, this function is called each tick and tells each sprite to update. For sprites in a sprite group, this is easy, because the SpriteGroup class includes an update function that calls update for each of it's sprites. So just add that to the end of the update_sprites function in bin/shooter, so it looks like the listing here: <placeholder-5/> The view_tick function is called once per tick as well. This funciton updates the view on the screen. We'll add a line of code to tell the bullets to draw themselves right under where the enemies draw themselves. <placeholder-6/> Finally, we need to pass a reference to each enemy as it is created and create a member variable to store that reference. So we need to make a change in the enemy.py fil, to add an argument for the SpriteGroup in the __init__ function, and also we need to pass the SpriteGroup when creating enemies. So change the Enemy class in enemy.py so the top of the __init__ function looks like so: <placeholder-7/> And then back in the bin/shooter file in the next_level function when creating enemies, pass in enemy_bullets. <placeholder-8/> Now we have a functioning sprite group and the enemies have a reference to it, we are ready to start actually adding some bullets to it. We'll do this by adding a member function called \"shoot\" to the enemy. Don't forget to import the Bullet class into the enemy.py file. <placeholder-9/> First thing is we'll check that the enemy is alive. We don't have to do this, but for this game, we don't want it to shoot if it's int the process of exploding. Then we'll just create a bullet and add it to the SpriteGroup. The last argument we'll pass in is to set the orientatin to 180. Orientation goes clockwise for 360 degrees, with zero being directly up, and 180 being directly down. In code, it looks like the listing below. <placeholder-10/> So now we just need to tell the enemies to shoot. We'll do this back in the bin/shooter file, in the\"controller_tick function. After the section where we respond to keyboard input, we'll add a few lines to make the enemies shoot. First, we'll make sure the game is not paused, not very fair to shoot in a paused game, is it? Next we'll loop through the enemies and desider if we should call shoot. using our friend random.randint, we'll do this say, one time twenty. So if you add this code to the end of the controller_tick function, your enemies will start dropping bombs. <placeholder-11/><placeholder-12/> So if you run the game, you'll see that the enemies are dropping bulltes like bombs. Nice. However, maybe it would be nicer if the sprites for the enemy bullets were different than the sprites for the guy's bullets. Remember at the beginning of the tutorial we added an image called enemy_bullet.png to the data/media directory. Now we'll write a bit of code to use that image. First thing, we should add a reference to it in the shooterconfig.py file. In this way, the Enemy class will be able to find it. Just add the following line along with the other image path setting code in shooterconfig.py. <placeholder-13/> So now we need to tell the bullets in the Enemy class to use that image. Fortunately the Bullet class takes an optional parameter for the name of an image to use. So just modify the shoot function in the Enemy class to include the path. <placeholder-14/> Now the enemies are dropping bombs with our new image. <placeholder-15/>"

To do this, we want to check if the bombs ever collide with the guy, and if they do, we'll tell the guy to explode, and then we'll remove the bomb from the screen. So the logic is \"tell me if the guy collides with any enemy_bullets\". There is a funciton for this called, pygame.sprite.spritecollideany, which takes a single sprite and a sprite group and returns a reference to any sprite in the sprite group that collided with the single sprite. If there were no collisions, than e will be None. Otherwise, we'll want to tell the guy to explode and tell the bullet to just \"kill\", which will remove it from play. So we can call it like this: <placeholder-1/> There is a function in bin/shooter called check_collisions which is called once per tick, and is the perfect place to add this code. Add it right under the similar test for the guy colliding with enemies. Now those bombs can kill the guys. <placeholder-2/> If you play for a bit, you may notice that the bullets and the bombs just kind of pass by each other. We can ramp up the game play by making the enemy bullets destroy the guy's bullets, but not visa versa. So that logic here is, have any of the sprites in the bullets sprite group collided with the bullets in the enemy bullets sprite group. There is function for this as well, pygame.sprite.groupcollide. groupcollide takes two sprite lists and returns a dictionary. The keys in the dictionary are any sprites from the first group that are involved in a collision, and the values are the sprites from the second group that collided with the sprite that for key. It's a bit hard to explain, but I bet the code is pretty readable. Add this line to the check_collisions function. <placeholder-3/> Now if you run the game, it's a bit more challenging as the enemies are a bit more offensive. This code just kills the bullets involed in any collisions. Notice that I passed in True False at the end of this function. These paramaters determine whether to kill sprites form either group involved in the collusion. The True tells the function to kill any bullets involved in collisions, so this was simple to code."

When the enemy bullets kill one of the guy's bullets, I'd like to play a little sound to signify this. So first, I added a little \"tink\" sound to the data/media directory. After you add your sound, you need to add a reference to it in the shootercongif.py file. <placeholder-1/> Now, I want to add a little code after the collision detection between the bullets to play that sound if they collided. I can't just hop straight to that though, first I have to create a sound object.In pygame you manage sounds with the \"mixer\" module. I don't want to create this object over and over again. So I'll add it to the bin/shooter file where the other objects and such for the game are set up. <placeholder-2/> Now that I've told the mixer module to give me a sound, I can go ahead and check if there were any collisions between bullets, and play my sound. <placeholder-3/> So it seems to be working well, but what if you are finding that one of the sounds is too quiet or too loud? Or perhpas you want a certain sound to be loud sometimes and queit other times, for example to simulate distance. This is easy to do because each sound object has a set_volume function that you can use to set the sound between 0 (for slient) and 1 (for normal volume). The bullet launch sound I used was a bit loud, so in the bullet.py file, I'll adjust the Bullet class to play the sound a bit more quietly. <placeholder-4/>"
