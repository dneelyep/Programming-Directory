QUICKLY
=======

Quickly is a container for sets of application templates and related commands.
Together, a set of commands and a template taken together are called a
"quickly template". Currently there is a single quickly template called the
"ubuntu-application template". As it can be infered, it is for creating Ubuntu
applications. :)

However, Quickly is designed so that quickly templates are easy to write. So,
if you are a fan of language, you can create a foo-project template. Or if
you want to help people making plugins for your killer app, you can make a
killer-app-plugin template. You can even create a template for managing
corporate documents, creating your awesome LaTeX helperâ€¦ The sky is the limit!


Given the richness and variety of the Linux platform, programming on Linux
should be easy and fun. However, it's not easy and fun because it is too hard
to learn. It is too hard to learn because there are too many choices. Quickly
strives to make programming easy and fun by bringing opinionated choices about
how to write different kinds of programs to developers.
