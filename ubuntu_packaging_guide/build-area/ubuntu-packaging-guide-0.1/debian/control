Description: Ubuntu Packaging Guide
 The Ubuntu Packaging Guide is a set of articles that should help you to get
 involved with packaging and development of Ubuntu. It's not meant to replace
 other great documentation like the Debian New Maintainer's Guide or the 
 Debian policy, but serve as a starting point with easy and simple to 
 understand articles.
