#Problem 1:
#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
    #we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

#So: find sum of all multiples of three less than 1000, find sum of all multiples of five less than 1000
#Add these and print the result
threemult == sum of multiples of three
fivemult == multiples of five
