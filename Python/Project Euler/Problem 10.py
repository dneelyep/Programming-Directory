#Problem 10
#The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
#Find the sum of all the primes below two million.





#So: find an effective method to calculate all the primes below a given
#  number. Then apply to 2,000,000 and add all these numbers for the sum



testingnumber = 10
currentnumber = 0

def checkprime:
    #starting at 0, check if number is a prime. If so, print then incr
    # Else, incr
    

    


















#So: Check if a digit is prime or not. If so, print it(for debugging) and add it
# to an array containing all primes.
#total sum variable. Then increment the variable, while variable < 2 million.
