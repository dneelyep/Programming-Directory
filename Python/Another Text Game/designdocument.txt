Story:

		Maybe you should check it out...if you're ready...

	The player walks into a steaming-hot room filled with lava and smoke. The player pushes through the fog, stumbling and comes upon a clearing...
		Half-man, half-fish like creatures with tridents are pushing back at some giant demon who has emerged from the lava...
		The demon is slaughtering the creatures mercilessly. They are all destroyed, the demon waits a minute...
			"Ooops" you lose your footing...the demon sees you...
			If player's attack is high enough, scares away demon
			If player's attack is super high, one-shots the demon
			If player's attack is too low, player loses, must restart game
