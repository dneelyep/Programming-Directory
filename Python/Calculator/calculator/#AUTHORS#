Intro to Part IX:
      -	Sounds like an interesting section. Working to dismantle oppression sounds more complex than originally hoped, but much more rewarding if done correctly. 

#2 hooks:
      -	"...that the superior should rule over the inferior..." (670) Interesting
      - "...it is first the potential oppressor within that we must resist..." (672) Interesting
      -	"If we are unable to resist and end domination in relations where there is care, it seems totally unimaginable that we can resist and end it in other institutionalized relations of power." Interesting WRT me and parents.
      - Interesting talking about how sexism is most important form, since it affects intimate relationships.
      -	Kind of interesting article. Seemed to just keep saying that feminist thought should also include race and class...

#8 Leonard:
      -	Very interesting article, with some parallels to the Free Software world I think.
      - Lots of focus on developing sexy new software, not a lot on legal issues (patents, trolls, net neutrality, etc) which seem to be root causes of a lot of issues
      -	Open Source vs Free Software - one that promotes making code available without necessarily allowing use (charity?) vs free reuse, etc (solidarity, solves systematic problems of the current method?)
