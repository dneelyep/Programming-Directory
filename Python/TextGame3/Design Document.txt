Text Game 3

Story: You've been abandoned in a dungeon without your cheezits. There seem to be pocket monsters everywhere, darting hither and yon for any crums they may 
       have dropped. You hear snoring a distance away and wonder what could possibly be that stinky and huge...

Goals:
- Create a small, one level dungeon-crawler
- Create an overworld map (from arrays within arrays (?), 20x20(?) that is gradually made visible as the user explores the map
	- Have the user randomly fight monsters every n steps he takes (n being a randomly generated number, likely in a given range of values [ie only a 
          number between 5 and 10 steps)
	- For each tile in the map, give it a property revealed(?) set to 0 when the player first starts. As the player discovers a given new tile, set 
          that tile's revealed value to 1 and display the content of the tile permanently.
	- The revealed property allows the tile to be displayed on the map - otherwise only a blank space(?) will show up
- Create a main character with statistics (attack, health, etc) that can be improved through fighting monsters
	- Fighting monsters gives the main character experience points which allows them to level up, increasing their health, attack, etc
- Implement classes of monsters with randomly generated stats within a certain range
	- IE a Snorlax could have between 200 and 220 health and between 5 and 6 attack
	- ...and a rattata could have between 50 and 70 health and between 2 and 3 attack, for example
- Display player stats in a fixed box at the bottom of the screen, have them update in response to changes (real-time)
	- Implement bars for all stats - IE instead of just displaying 50/100 health, show a half-filled bar, maybe with 50/100 inside or beside it
- Add a secret, Giant Turd, boss?
- Have an icon on the top-right of screen indicating whether the player is in the Dungeon Map or a Battle


Accomplished:
- Implement a menu screen, options for Help, New Game, Quit
- Let the player select their own name (limited to 6 or 7 characters - due to the fixed box at the bottom of the screen





To Do:
- Implement all of the above

Completed:
- Implement a menu screen, options for Help, New Game, Quit
- Create fancy intro logo, with fancy menu
- Let the player select their own name (limited to 6 or 7 characters - due to the fixed box at the bottom of the screen
