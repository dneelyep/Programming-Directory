<?php
/*If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
  we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

So: set $currentnum = 1. For $currentnum in range 1-1000: check if
  $currentnum % 3 = 0 and if $currentnum % 5 = 0. If yes to either of those,
  add the value of $currentnum to the value of $threenums or $fivenums. Then
  increment $currentnum by 1 and repeat the loop until $currentnum = 1000.
  Add the values of $threenums and $fivenums. That should be the answer.*/

$currentnum = 1;
$threenums  = 0;
$fivenums   = 0;

while ($currentnum < 1000)
	time();

echo "$currentnum";
