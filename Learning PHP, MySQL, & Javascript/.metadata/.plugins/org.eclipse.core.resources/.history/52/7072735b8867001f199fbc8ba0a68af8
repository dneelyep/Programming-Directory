/*If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
  we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.*/
//So: set $currentnumber = 1. For $currentnumber in range 1-1000: check if
//  $currentnumber % 3 = 0 and if $currentnumber % 5 = 0.
