Goal:
	Online music collaboration software that lets users:
	       - Create accounts to track their contributions
	       - Submit their recordings of tracks to "compositions".
	       - Compositions sorted by composer, instruments, other categories.
	       - Bug-tracking features allowing users to mark status of each composition and its component parts (each music track)
	       	 	    - IE: Status - Complete/In progress/Incomplete/etc.
	       - Licensing integration?
	       - Facilities for downloading compositions
	       	 	    - "Binaries" (the final "mix" - the full recording of the work)
			    - "Source" (final mix + each component part (instrument recordings, etc.)
			    













Jotting down some quick ideas I had today:

So projects such as <a href="http://www.musopen.com" title="musopen" target="_blank">Musopen</a> (are there others?) seem to be attempting to create a large library of public domain music. It seems that Musopen at least doesn't have all the recordings it aspires to attain (every single public domain recording I assume).

Anyways, a problem I see might be that there's not very high-quality (that I know of at least) collaboration software in place to allow contributors to effectively contribute to the project. The current system encourages users to upload a complete recording of the work in question, ideally with all instruments recorded and mixed well. Doing things this way, especially for larger works that might require the work of a large number of musicians, plus effective recording of instruments, and the consent of all performers/technical workers to release their work in the public domain. As one can imagine, gathering together this large number of people to work on such a project would probably be quite difficult.

I have a feeling that there are a lot of <strong>individual</strong> performers and skilled mixers/etc. who are interested in Musopen's goals and would like to contribute to its cause. However, an individual person interested in contributing isn't enough to bring large, orchestral works into being.

So, how could this process be improved?

I propose developing some new software that could be used for Musopen and other similar music-collaboration projects. I wouldn't be surprised if this software already exists, so if it does, 'doh!

Some ideas behind the new software would be applying some principles that have helped the Free Software movement create great software to this project, such as the following:

<ul>
<li>Crowd-sourcing work</li>
Many hands make light work
Large number of people with skills that can be used - giving them the ability to feasibly contribute is neccessary
<li>Generating source and binaries rather than just binaries</li>
Allows more remixing, mashups, etc.
Allows alternate mixes of tracks, with emphasis on different instruments, etc.
Great for people interested in having backing tracks to practice to.
Could be distributed as either "binaries" (the complete song) or "source" (each individual instrument track), depending on the user's desires.
If someone can record a better instrument track, makes it possible to reincorporate that better track into the recording, making a better overall final recording.
Allows "mixers" to freely mix-and-match tracks to create different "interpretations" of compositions
Turns the work from free as in beer to potentially free as in freedom
<li>Bug tracking-like system</li>
With Musopen, goal is a free public domain library of the world's PD music.
So, a system could be implemented where every PD work is listed, along with completion status, instrument recordings, etc.
<li>Many people can get involved - barrier to entry low.
People only need the skill to play the required parts and record their instruments.
</ul>
