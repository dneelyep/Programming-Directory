    <p>Computing is a huge subject. Within Computer Science (the academic field that researches things such as how computers work, what the limits of computers are, artificial intelligence, and other fascinating subjects) there are sub-fields of study, and sub-fields of sub-fields, and [improve]. Suffice it to say that there are lifetimes worth of cool stuff to learn about computers. But we won't focus so much on [INSERTCRAZYDIFFICULTEQUATIONTECHNOBABBLE]. Leave that stuff for the people who do this for a living, or maybe even yourself if ya take a liking to this computer stuff.</p>
    <h2>Computers</h2>
    <h3>Basic Operation</h3>
    What is a computer?/Turing-complete machine
    What are computers used for?
    Binary
    CPU
      CPU cycle
    Memory (primarysecondaryetc)
      Library analogy. Make sure to quote book if so (the book on parallel computing).
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>Thinking About Computers</h3>
    KB? MB? Ghz?
      Draw connection between chemistry etc units of measurement. Maybe something about the metric system and 'standard' system?
    Open Source? Linux?
      Discuss mechanics working on a "black box" machine - a machine whose internals you can't see, vs working on an open machine a la Linux.
