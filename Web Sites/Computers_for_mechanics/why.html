    "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." -- Arthur C. Clarke [MAKETHISSEXY...ITALICSCENTER?]

    <p>So you may be wondering what the purpose of this site is exactly. A bit of background information first.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>After a few enlightening discussions with my father (a maintenance worker for a factory) where I tried to explain how computers work, we found a lot of parallels between the inner workings of computers and machines such as cars and some machines he works on. Automobiles and other "hands-on" types of machinery can make for effective analogies to help bridge the gap of understanding between myself (interested in technology, music, the arts) and my father (interested in hunting, music, and cars I think).</p>
    <h2>So why make a site about you and your father's conversations?</h2>
    <p>There seem to be a lot of people (myself included) in the world with a very limited understanding of computers and how they work. For most, a computer is a magical tool that helps to accomplish specific tasks, not a mind-bogglingly complex and interesting machine that can be used to do [INSERTCOOLEXAMPLES]. In other words, many people view computers as a tool rather than a means of self-expression and a great outlet for creativity.</p>
    <h2>Cool dude. That doesn't explain why I would want to learn about how computers work.</h2>
    <p>Computers are great! Learning about computers helps you out in many ways:
      <ul>
	<li>Learning about computers takes away the "magic little box" effect. The more you know about a computer, the more sense the machine makes. This seems like common sense, but it's a very important point. In a general way, knowing more about an area of expertise can turn a mind-numbingly difficult problem into a simple fix. [INSERTRELEVANTQUOTE]</li>
	<li>Removing the magic effect is [boldthis]NOT[/bold] a bad thing. It's often said that learning about certain subjects takes the "magic" away from them. I think that anyone who has learned to play a musical instrument with skill, or who has learned exactly how [XPHENOMENOMWORKS] would beg to differ. Learning more about a subject can [italics]increase vastly[/italics] one's appreciation for that subject.

 In the David Kushner book, Masters of Doom, (Random House, 2003) p. 295. Kushner is describing the programmer John Carmack:
“…after so many years immersed in the science of graphics, he [John Carmack] had achieved an almost Zen-like understanding of his craft. In the shower, he would see a few bars of light on the wall and think, Hey, that’s a diffuse specular reflection from the overhead lights reflected off the faucet. Rather than detaching him from the natural world, this viewpoint only made him appreciate it more deeply. ‘These are things I find enchanting and miraculous,’ he said, ‘I don’t have to be at the Grand Canyon to appreciate the way the world works. I can see that in reflections of light in my bathroom.’” </li>

	<li>Aside from the most important benefit of computer knowledge (a greater appreciation for a complex subject), there are many practical benefits to learning about computers. Among them are potentially vast improvements in your ability to find information, improvements in your productivity in things you already work on (for example, writing documents more efficiently or researching information on how to fix a problem in your house), and other things. It should be emphasized though that learning about computers can be [italics]an end in itself[/italics].</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Enough of me harping on the benefits of learning about computers - by now I'm likely preaching to the choir. My goal is that by creating this web site, more people will have a better understanding of how computers work and a greater appreciation for them.</p>
    <p>I'll finish with a few quotations to ruminate on:
      
      "We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces." -- Carl Sagan [TOOELITIST?][INCLUDEBOOKREFERENCE]
      "ADDMOAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"

Also maybe discuss the logical core of both, ie troubleshooting and such. Maybe explain that that core creates a link to allow understanding between the two fields.
