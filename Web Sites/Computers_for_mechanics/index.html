    <p>Welcome to Computers for Mechanics, a site focused on showing mechanically-inclined (or otherwise non-technical) people the joys of computers.</p>
    <p>To get started, check out the <a href="progression.html">recommended progression of subjects</a>, the <a href="topics.html">topic overview</a>, or the <a href="subjects.html">alphabetical listing of subjects</a>. Most of all, have fun!
Basic Idea:
    Create a web site focused on providing articles, etc to teach mechanically-inclined
        people (ie mechanics/maintenance people/etc) how computers work.

Ideas for Structure:
    An index of articles alphabetically.
    Search functionality built-in.
    A suggested progression of articles to read.
    Topics that list related articles.
    Extensive cross-linking.

    Eventually create a book with relevant info.
    Figure out licensing information.
