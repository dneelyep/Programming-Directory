How to make this work:

Goal:
	- Have a system set up where a user can:
		- Create their own username and a few more fields
		- Register that username into a database
		- Log in with that username and password
		- While logged in, view a page that displays the fields they entered above
		- After registered, be able to edit the values they originally entered [optional]

What I need to implement:
	- A Welcome page, prompting the user to register or log in
	- A register page
	- A "thanks for registering" page
	- An account home page for the user
	- A page to edit account details for the user [optional]

Breakdown:
	- Welcome page
		- A welcome message, which prompts the user to Sign In or Register
			- Should consist of a box with two input fields - Username and Password
			- In bottom of box, include a Register link to the Register page
			- Below all this, a Submit button to sign in
				- Clicking submit sends the user to their account home page
	- Register page
		- Has Username and Password input fields for the user to add these
		- Includes other miscellaneous fields as well
		- A Submit button which, when clicked, logs the user in with their new account and sends them to the
			Thanks page
	- Thanks page
		- Display a "Thanks for registering" message and redirect the user to their account home page
	- Account home page
		- Displays the user's Username and any other miscellaneous fields they have added
			- Beside all fields beside Username, the user can click a button to change the field's value
	- Edit account details page [optional]
