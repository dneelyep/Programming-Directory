<h3>Chris</h3>
<h4>Instrument: Bass Guitar/Vocals</h4>
<p class="margin">
Chris was born on August 5th, 1955 and has been playing music since his high school days. He played music regularly from 1971 through 1981, then got married
and put his music on the back shelf for awhile. After his two sons Steven and Daniel started getting old enough to get interested in music he started jamming with them.
They played at different restaurants in Bardstown and Elizabethtown. His youngest son Daniel plays with him now in Shakedown, while his oldest son Steven, an avid guitarist, is currently serving in Iraq.
 Who knows - maybe someday they all three will be playing together again. His wife Margaret loves to watch the band when they play and is a very active part
of the group. Chris currently gives bass and guitar lessons in his spare time between a full time job and playing out on weekends. His love for music is unmatched whether
he's playing or just listening to it. If you've ever seen him play, you have probably seen his passion unfold on stage.
</p>
<p class="margin">
Chris has played everything from church music to country to blues to metal, but his favorite is current and classic rock. He used to play guitar but when a bassist
couldn't be found for his band, he decided to give the bass a whirl, immediately falling in love with it.
</p>
<p class="margin">
He tries to stay focused on the crowd's reaction to the songs he plays and if a song doesn't go over well, it gets canned. He believes strongly that when you play out live,
you play for the crowd, so you'd better play what they want to hear.
</p>
<p class="margin">
Come listen to Chris and Shakedown - you won't be disappointed!
