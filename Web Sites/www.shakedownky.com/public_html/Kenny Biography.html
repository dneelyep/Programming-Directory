<h3>Kenny</h3>
<h4>Instrument: Electric Guitar/Vocals</h4>
<p class="margin">Kenny Harrington was born on December 12, 1956 in Marion County, Kentucky. After finishing school in 1975, the leader of a popular area group called Cheyenne
 spotted him in a local music store. He was then hired as a roadie and eventually as a guitarist. They did one LP of top 40 covers. Kenny’s next group, called Landslide,
 played in the late 70's and featured Larry McDonald on vocals/drums and Bill Wilson on bass/vocals. Bill Lester came later on guitar/vocals, eventually being replaced 
 by Richard Patterson on guitar/vocals. This group lasted about 4 years. Richard’s then wife Marty was added to the lineup and the band’s name was changed to FeverCat. 
 Then in 1986, the rock band XYZ was formed with Richard Patterson on guitar/vocals/keyboards, Paul Moore on bass/vocals, Byron Cravens on drums and Rebecca White on vocals.
 In 1988, Kenny joined a group from Lexington called Phoenix who were the house band at the Continental Inn. This band travelled twenty six weeks a year, although the gig ended
 in 1990. Then in the late 90's, he went to work for Crooked Creek along with, again, Larry McDonald and Richard Patterson, which lasted 3 years. Kenny’s current project
 started from a jam at a friend's party and has brought them to form Shakedown. Chris Neel is on bass/vocals, Daniel Neel is on drums, and Kenny is playing guitar/guitar synth.
 They are on a mission to play classic rock covers, new country and to entertain all age groups.</p>

<p class="margin">Kenny is married, has four children, and has two grandchildren. He is the oldest of nine children. His father was in the military and his family travelled
 a lot. He got his first guitar when he was 13 and played in his first band at age 18.</p>

<p class="margin">Kenny’s musical influences include Billy Gibbons, Joe Satriani, Johnny Winter, Floyd Radford, Gary Rossington, Rod Price, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards,
 John Fogerty, and more.</p>
