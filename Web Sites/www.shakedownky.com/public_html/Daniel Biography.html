<h3>Daniel</h3>
<h4>Instrument: Drums/Percussion</h4>
<p class="margin">Daniel Neel is the drummer of Shakedown and the son of bassist and singer Chris Neel. He's been playing the drums for about six or seven years and has put the skills he's learned in this time to good use in Shakedown. Daniel is an avid fan of music of most varieties, although he particularly enjoys music of a technically-challenging nature. He makes sure to keep his performance in control with Shakedown to keep from scaring off too many listeners. The skills he's built up over the years while playing drums combined with his love for challenging music can make for some interesting drum patterns when performing in Shakedown.</p>
<p class="margin">Make sure to keep an eye on Daniel's playing when you watch Shakedown. He may not be the most visually extravagent of players, but if one pays attention to the music he creates,
 they most likely will be pleasantly surprised.</p>
