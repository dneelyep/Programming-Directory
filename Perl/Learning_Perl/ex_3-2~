#Write a program that reads a list of numbers (on separate lines) until end-of-
#input and then prints for each number the corresponding person's name from the
#list shown below. (Hardcode this list of names into your program. That is, it should
#appear in your program's source code.) For example, if the input numbers were
#1, 2, 4, and 2, the output names would be fred, betty, dino, and betty:
#    fred betty barney dino wilma pebbles bamm-bamm
