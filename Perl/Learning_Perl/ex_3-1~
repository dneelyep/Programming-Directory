#Write a program that reads a list of strings on separate lines until end-of-input
#and prints out the list in reverse order. If the input comes from the keyboard, you'll
#probably need to signal the end of the input by pressing Control-D on Unix, or
#Control-Z on Windows.

print "Ahoy thar again matey! Today you're going to give me multi-line input, and I will reverse it for you. Capiche?";
