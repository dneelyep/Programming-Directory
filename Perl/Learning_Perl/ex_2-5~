#Write a program that prompts for and reads a string and a number (on separate
#lines of input) and prints out the string the number of times indicated by the num-
#ber on separate lines. (Hint: use the x operator.) If the user enters "fred" and "3",
#the output should be three lines, each saying "fred". If the user enters "fred" and
#"299792", there may be a lot of output.
